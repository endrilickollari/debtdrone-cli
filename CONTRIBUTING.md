## 🔨 Build System

### Local Development

```bash
# Standard build
make build

# Install locally
make install

# Uninstall
make uninstall
```

### Testing Cross-Compilation

```bash
# Build for all platforms
make snapshot

# Check artifacts
ls -la dist/
```

### Understanding CGO

DebtDrone uses CGO for Tree-sitter integration:
- Requires C/C++ compilation
- Cross-compilation needs Docker
- Longer build times (~5-10 min)

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed information.

## 📦 Release Process

Only maintainers can create releases.

### Creating a Release

Releases are test-gated and created through the manually dispatched **Release**
GitHub Actions workflow. Do not create or push release tags directly. Select a
Semantic Version according to [the versioning policy](docs/versioning.md), run
the workflow from `main`, and monitor it through publication and the SaaS
dependency-update dispatch.

After publication, test installation:

   ```bash
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endrilickollari/debtdrone-cli/main/install.sh | bash
   debtdrone --version
   ```
